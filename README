Libs dependancy:

1. OpenGL things, such as glut3 etc
2. Matrix libs: armadillo, eigen3 (needed by geometry utils)


Instructions (some obsolete)

1. "make" to compile 
2. make sure the graph is connected otherwise it is not a graph! (mod radius in define.h if edges are generated of neighbors within certain radius)
3. modify the starts, goals, and other nodes (body) in configs/topo.txt 
4. lambda is option "-l".  l>=0, when lambda is 0, the paths are globally shortest for all paths; when lambda is increased, say, to 10, more vertices will be involved in the paths.
5. to turn off the gui, use -g flag 


To run
./simu

To control the lambda, e.g., 
./simu -l 0.5

To clean sim
  make clean
To deeply clean
  make reallyclean
